# Bare bones project template for pytorch with support for different configurations

## Training models
python train.py \<config name\>

## Testing trained models
python test.py \<valid/test\> \<config name\> 

## Warning
As this is a template project, it is not debugged and not able to run config files yet, because app specific config files/data iterators should be written before training/testing models.
